Description: The Dirichlet (aka NBD-Dirichlet) model describes the
        purchase incidence and brand choice of consumer products.  We
        estimate the model and summarize various theoretical quantities
        of interest to marketing researchers. Also provides functions
        for making tables that compare observed and theoretical
        statistics.
